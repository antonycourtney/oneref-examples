# OneRef Examples

This repository contains example applications for [OneRef](https://github.com/antonycourtney/oneref), a minimalist approach to unidirectional data flow for React applications.

OneRef and these examples are described in the blog post **TODO: link to article**.

The examples here were ported from the corresponding [Flux examples](https://github.com/facebook/flux/tree/master/examples):

- **todomvc/** - Port of the classic [TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/) example to OneRef.
